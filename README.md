# Reclassifing NBA Players through Unsupervised Learning

In modern basketball game, only five positions are not enough to accurately describe players’ diverse playstyles. This research paper aims at redefining classes for NBA players using two unsupervised learning methods: K-Means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models. Players’ metrics were crawled and then further cleansed. Concerning the dimensionality of the dataset, feature selection using cor- relation matrix and dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis were both applied. The processed matrix was fit into both clustering method and Gaussian Mixture Models yielded desirable results with 8 clusters being successfully grouped.
